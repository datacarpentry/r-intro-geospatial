## Motivation

Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and
collected data, the real fun begins! This lesson will teach you how to start
this process using R and RStudio. We will begin with raw data, perform
exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. This example
starts with a dataset from [gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org) containing
population information for many countries through time. Can you read the data
into R? Can you plot the population for Senegal? Can you calculate the average
income for countries on the continent of Asia? By the end of these lessons you
will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries
in under a minute!

## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

- [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Introduction to RStudio

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of
the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for
scientific projects that will make your life easier.

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development environment
(IDE). It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including on
servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control
and project management.



**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png)


## Workflow within RStudio

There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's shortcut keys for the Run command
to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 
>
> 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or 
> 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 
> 3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> in Windows,
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Linux, 
> or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
> (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselect the section and `Run`, you can use the next
> button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. When you are running
a section of your code, this is the location where R will first read your code,
attempt to execute them, and then returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:


~~~
1 + 100
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 101
~~~
{: .output}

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "`[1]`". Don't worry about
this for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating
output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "`+`" instead of a "`>`", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel a
command you can simply hit "<kbd>Esc</kbd>" and RStudio will give you back the "`>`" prompt.

> ## Tip: Cancelling commands
>
> If you're using R from the command line instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>
> to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.
>
{: .callout}

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`


~~~
3 + 5 * 2
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 13
~~~
{: .output}

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.


~~~
(3 + 5) * 2
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 16
~~~
{: .output}

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but  clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.


~~~
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
~~~
{: .language-r}


The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:


~~~
2/10000
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2e-04
~~~
{: .output}

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:


~~~
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 5000
~~~
{: .output}

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You can look them up
on Google, or if you can remember the start of the function's name, use the tab
completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it has auto-completion
abilities that allow you to more easily look up functions, their arguments, and
the values that they take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page for that
command. As well as providing a detailed description of the command and how it
works, scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually show a collection
of code examples which illustrate command usage. We'll go through an example
later.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparison in R:


~~~
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 < 2  # less than
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 > 0  # greater than
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:


~~~
x <- 1/40
~~~
{: .language-r}

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:


~~~
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.025
~~~
{: .output}

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:


~~~
log(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] -3.688879
~~~
{: .output}

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:


~~~
x <- 100
~~~
{: .language-r}

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:


~~~
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
~~~
{: .language-r}

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:


~~~
x = 1/40
~~~
{: .language-r}

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

## Installing Packages

We can use R as a calculator to do mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as we did above. However, we can also use R to carry out more complicated analyses, make visualizations, and much more. In later episodes, we'll use R to do some data wrangling, plotting, and saving of reformatted data.

R coders around the world have developed collections of R code to accomplish themed tasks (e.g., data wrangling). These collections of R code are known as *R packages*. It is also important to note that R packages refer to code that is *not* automatically downloaded when we install R on our computer. Therefore, we'll have to install each R package that we want to use (more on this below).

We will practice using the `dplyr` package to wrangle our datasets in episode 6 and will also practice using the `ggplot2` package to plot our data in episode 7. To give an example, the `dplyr` package includes code for a function called `filter()`. A *function* is something that takes input(s) does some internal operations and produces output(s). For the `filter()` function, the inputs are a dataset and a logical statement (i.e., when data value is greater than or equal to 100) and the output is data within the dataset that has a value greater than or equal to 100.

There are two main ways to install packages in R:

1. If you are using RStudio, we can go to `Tools` > `Install Packages...` and then search for the name of the R package we need and click `Install`.

2. We can use the `install.packages( )` function. We can do this to install the `dplyr` R package.


~~~
install.packages("dplyr")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Installing package into '/home/runner/work/_temp/Library'
(as 'lib' is unspecified)
~~~
{: .output}

It's important to note that we only need to install the R package on our computer once. Well, if we install a new version of R on the same computer, then we will likely need to also re-install the R packages too.

> ## Challenge 4
>
> What code would we use to install the `ggplot2` package?
>
> > ## Solution to challenge 4
> >
> > We would use the following R code to install the `ggplot2` package:
> > 
> > ~~~
> > install.packages("ggplot2")
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-r}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Now that we've installed the R package, we're ready to use it! To use the R package, we need to "load" it into our R session. We can think of "loading" an R packages as telling R that we're ready to use the package we just installed. It's important to note that while we only have to install the package *once*, we'll have to load the package *each time we open R (or RStudio)*.

To load an R package, we use the `library( )` function. We can load the `dplyr` package like this:


~~~
library(dplyr)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Attaching package: 'dplyr'
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

    filter, lag
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
~~~
{: .output}
