## Reference

## [Introduction to R and RStudio](episodes/01-rstudio-intro.Rmd)

- Use the escape key to cancel incomplete commands or running code
  (Ctrl+C) if you're using R from the shell.
- Basic arithmetic operations follow standard order of precedence:
  - Brackets: `(`, `)`
  - Exponents: `^` or `**`
  - Divide: `/`
  - Multiply: `*`
  - Add: `+`
  - Subtract: `-`
- Scientific notation is available, e.g: `2e-3`
- Anything to the right of a `#` is a comment, R will ignore this!
- Functions are denoted by `function_name()`. Expressions inside the
  brackets are evaluated before being passed to the function, and
  functions can be nested.
- Comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
- Use `all.equal` to compare numbers!
- `<-` is the assignment operator. Anything to the right is evaluate, then
  stored in a variable named to the left.
- `ls` lists all variables and functions you've created
- `rm` can be used to remove them
- When assigning values to function arguments, you *must* use `=`.

## [Project management with RStudio](episodes/02-project-intro.Rmd)

- To create a new project, go to File -> New Project
- Some best practices:
  - Treat data as read-only
  - Keep cleaned data separate from raw dirty data
  - Treat generated output as disposable
  - Keep related data together
  - Use a consistent naming scheme

## [Data Structures](episodes/03-data-structures-part1.Rmd)

- Use `read.csv()` to import data in memory
- ` class()` gives you the data class of your object
- R automatic converts data types
- The functions: `length()`, `nrow()`, `head()`, `tail()`, and `str()` can be
  useful to explore data.
- Factors are a special class to deal with categorical data.
- Lists provide a flexible data type.
- Data frames are a special case of lists.

## [Exploring Data Frames](episodes/04-data-structures-part2.Rmd)

- R makes it easy to import datasets storred remotely
- `?data.frame` is a key data structure. It is a `list` of `vectors`.
- `cbind()` will add a column (vector) to a data.frame.
- `rbind()` will add a row (list) to a data.frame.

**Useful functions for querying data structures:**

- `?str` structure, prints out a summary of the whole data structure
- `?class` what is the data structure?
- `?head` print the first `n` elements (rows for two-dimensional objects)
- `?tail` print the last `n` elements (rows for two-dimensional objects)
- `?rownames`, `?colnames`, `?dimnames` retrieve or modify the row names
  and column names of an object.
- `?length` get the number of elements in an atomic vector
- `?nrow`, `?ncol`, `?dim` get the dimensions of a n-dimensional object
  (Won't work on atomic vectors or lists).

- If your data frame contains factors, you need to take extra steps to add rows
  that contain new level values.

- `read.csv` to read in data in a regular structure
  - `sep` argument to specify the separator
    - "," for comma separated
    - "\\t" for tab separated
  - Other arguments:
    - `header=TRUE` if there is a header row

## [Subsetting data](episodes/05-data-subsetting.Rmd)

- Elements can be accessed by:
  
  - Index
  - Name
  - Logical vectors

- `[` single square brackets:
  
  - *extract* single elements or *subset* vectors
  - e.g.`x[1]` extracts the first item from vector x.
  - *extract* single elements of a list. The returned value will be another `list()`.
  - *extract* columns from a data.frame

- `[` with two arguments to:
  
  - *extract* rows and/or columns of
    - matrices
    - data.frames
    - e.g. `x[1,2]` will extract the value in row 1, column 2.
    - e.g. `x[2,:]` will extract the entire second column of values.

- `[[` double square brackets to extract items from lists.

- `$` to access columns or list elements by name

- negative indices skip elements

## [Data frame manipulation with dplyr](episodes/06-dplyr.Rmd)

- `?select` to extract variables by name.
- `?filter` return rows with matching conditions.
- `?group_by` group data by one of more variables.
- `?summarize` summarize multiple values to a single value.
- `?mutate` add new variables to a data.frame.
- `?count` and `?n` to tally values in the data frame.
- Combine operations using the `?"%>%"` pipe operator.

## [Control flow](episodes/07-plot-ggplot2.Rmd)

- figures can be created with the grammar of graphics:
  - `library(ggplot2)`
  - `ggplot` to create the base figure
  - `aes`thetics specify the data axes, shape, color, and data size
  - `geom`etry functions specify the type of plot, e.g. `point`, `line`, `density`, `box`
  - `geom`etry functions also add statistical transforms, e.g. `geom_smooth`
  - `scale` functions change the mapping from data to aesthetics
  - `facet` functions stratify the figure into panels
  - `aes`thetics apply to individual layers, or can be set for the whole plot
    inside `ggplot`.
  - `theme` functions change the overall look of the plot
  - order of layers matters!
  - `ggsave` to save a figure.

## [Writing data](episodes/08-writing-data.Rmd)

- `write.table` to write out objects in regular format

## Glossary

[argument]{#argument}
:   A value given to a function or program when it runs.
The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with [parameter](#parameter).

[assign]{#assign}
:   To give a value a name by associating a variable with it.

[body]{#body}
:   (of a function): the statements that are executed when a function runs.

[comment]{#comment}
:   A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on,
but is ignored by the computer.
Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a `#` character and run to the end of the line;
comments in SQL start with `--`,
and other languages have other conventions.

[comma-separated values]{#comma-separated-values}
:   (CSV) A common textual representation for tables
in which the values in each row are separated by commas.

[delimiter]{#delimiter}
:   A character or characters used to separate individual values,
such as the commas between columns in a [CSV](#comma-separated-values) file.

[documentation]{#documentation}
:   Human-language text written to explain what software does,
how it works, or how to use it.

[floating-point number]{#floating-point-number}
:   A number containing a fractional part and an exponent.
See also: [integer](#integer).

[for loop]{#for-loop}
:   A loop that is executed once for each value in some kind of set, list, or range.
See also: [while loop](#while-loop).

[index]{#index}
:   A subscript that specifies the location of a single value in a collection,
such as a single pixel in an image.

[integer]{#integer}
:   A whole number, such as -12343. See also: [floating-point number](#floating-point-number).

[library]{#library}
:   In R, the directory(ies) where [packages](#package) are stored.

[package]{#package}
:   A collection of R functions, data and compiled code in a well-defined format. Packages are stored in a [library](#library) and loaded using the library() function.

[parameter]{#parameter}
:   A variable named in the function's declaration that is used to hold a value passed into the call.
The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with [argument](#argument).

[return statement]{#return-statement}
:   A statement that causes a function to stop executing and return a value to its caller immediately.

[sequence]{#sequence}
:   A collection of information that is presented in a specific order.

[shape]{#shape}
:   An array's dimensions, represented as a vector.
For example, a 5Ã—3 array's shape is `(5,3)`.

[string]{#string}
:   Short for "character string",
a [sequence](#sequence) of zero or more characters.

[syntax error]{#syntax-error}
:   A programming error that occurs when statements are in an order or contain characters
not expected by the programming language.

[type]{#type}
:   The classification of something in a program (for example, the contents of a variable)
as a kind of number (e.g. [floating-point](#floating-point-number), [integer](#integer)), [string](#string),
or something else. In R the command typeof() is used to query a variables type.

[while loop]{#while-loop}
:   A loop that keeps executing as long as some condition is true.
See also: [for loop](#for-loop).
