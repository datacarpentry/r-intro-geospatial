- Leave about 30 minutes at the start of each workshop and another 15 mins at 
  the start of each session for technical difficulties like WiFi and installing 
  things (even if you asked students to install in advance, longer if not).
- Be sure to actually go through examples of an R help page: help files can be 
  intimidating at first, but knowing how to read them is tremendously useful.
- Don't worry about being correct or knowing the material back-to-front. Use
  mistakes as teaching moments: the most vital skill you can impart is how to
  debug and recover from unexpected errors.

## Motivation

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

- This lesson is designed to introduce learners to the core concepts of R that 
they will need in order to complete the other lessons in this workshop. 
- It is intended for learners who have no prior experience with R. If your 
  workshop learners have all completed another Software or Data Carpentry R 
  workshop, or have taken courses in R, you can skip this lesson and move 
  straight into the 
  [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R] (https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) 
  lesson.
- This lesson is a trimmed-down version of the 
  [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder) 
  SWC lesson. It does not cover visualization in detail, as the later lesson in 
  this workshop covers visualization in the context of geospatial data.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and
collected data, the real fun begins! This lesson will teach you how to start
this process using R and RStudio. We will begin with raw data, perform
exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. This example
starts with a dataset from [gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org) containing
population information for many countries through time. Can you read the data
into R? Can you plot the population for Senegal? Can you calculate the average
income for countries on the continent of Asia? By the end of these lessons you
will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries
in under a minute!

## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

- [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

- If your workshop includes the [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/) lesson, learners will have
  just been introduced to RStudio in the context of the overall Geospatial
  software landscape.
- Have your learners open RStudio and follow along as you explain each pane. Make sure that your RStudio environment is the default so learners can follow along.
- Be sure to explain how to execute code from the script window, whether you're
  using the Run button or the keyboard shortcut.
- Learners will be using several packages in the next lesson, so be sure to
  introduce what a package is and how it is installed.
  
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction to RStudio

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of
the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for
scientific projects that will make your life easier.

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development environment
(IDE). It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including on
servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control
and project management.

**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

- The interactive R console (entire left)
- Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![](fig/01-rstudio.png){alt='RStudio layout'}

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

![](fig/01-rstudio-script.png){alt='RStudio layout with .R file open'}

## Workflow within RStudio

There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
  a .R file to run later.
  - This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
  - It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's shortcut keys for the Run command
  to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
  interactive R console.
  - This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
  - You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
    or using R's `source()`  function.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Running segments of your code

RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
current line, you can

1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or
2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or
3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>Enter</kbd> in Windows,
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Linux,
  or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>\+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
  (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
  the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
  If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
  there is no need to reselect the section and `Run`, you can use the next
  button
  along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
  including the modifications you have made.
  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. When you are running
a section of your code, this is the location where R will first read your code,
attempt to execute them, and then returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:


```r
1 + 100
```

```{.output}
[1] 101
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "`[1]`". Don't worry about
this for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating
output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

```r
> 1 +
```

```output
+
```

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "`+`" instead of a "`>`", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel a
command you can simply hit "<kbd>Esc</kbd>" and RStudio will give you back the "`>`" prompt.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Cancelling commands

If you're using R from the command line instead of from within RStudio,
you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>
to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!

Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
currently writing.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

- Parentheses: `(`, `)`
- Exponents: `^` or `**`
- Divide: `/`
- Multiply: `*`
- Add: `+`
- Subtract: `-`


```r
3 + 5 * 2
```

```{.output}
[1] 13
```

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.


```r
(3 + 5) * 2
```

```{.output}
[1] 16
```

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but  clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.


```r
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```

The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:


```r
2/10000
```

```{.output}
[1] 2e-04
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:


```r
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```

```{.output}
[1] 5000
```

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You can look them up
using a search engine, or if you can remember the start of the function's name, 
use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it has auto-completion
abilities that allow you to more easily look up functions, their arguments, and
the values that they take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page for that
command. As well as providing a detailed description of the command and how it
works, scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually show a collection
of code examples which illustrate command usage. We'll go through an example
later.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparison in R:


```r
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{.output}
[1] TRUE
```


```r
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{.output}
[1] TRUE
```


```r
1 < 2  # less than
```

```{.output}
[1] TRUE
```


```r
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

```{.output}
[1] TRUE
```


```r
1 > 0  # greater than
```

```{.output}
[1] TRUE
```


```r
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

```{.output}
[1] TRUE
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Comparing Numbers

A word of warning about comparing numbers: you should
never use `==` to compare two numbers unless they are
integers (a data type which can specifically represent
only whole numbers).

Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a
certain degree of precision, so two numbers which look
the same when printed out by R, may actually have
different underlying representations and therefore be
different by a small margin of error (called Machine
numeric tolerance).

Instead you should use the `all.equal` function.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:


```r
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:


```r
x
```

```{.output}
[1] 0.025
```

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:


```r
log(x)
```

```{.output}
[1] -3.688879
```

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:


```r
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:


```r
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 1

What will be the value of each  variable  after each
statement in the following program?


```r
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 1


```r
mass <- 47.5
```

This will give a value of 47.5 for the variable mass


```r
age <- 122
```

This will give a value of 122 for the variable age


```r
mass <- mass * 2.3
```

This will multiply the existing value of 47.5 by 2.3 to give a new value of
109.25 to the variable mass.


```r
age <- age - 20
```

This will subtract 20 from the existing value of 122 to give a new value
of 102 to the variable age.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 2

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to
compare mass to age. Is mass larger than age?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 2

One way of answering this question in R is to use the `>` to set up the following:


```r
mass > age
```

```{.output}
[1] TRUE
```

This should yield a boolean value of TRUE since 109.25 is greater than 102.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

- periods.between.words
- underscores\_between\_words
- camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:


```r
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 3

Which of the following are valid R variable names?


```r
min_height
max.height
_age
.mass
MaxLength
min-length
2widths
celsius2kelvin
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 3

The following can be used as R variables:


```r
min_height
max.height
MaxLength
celsius2kelvin
```

The following creates a hidden variable:


```r
.mass
```

We won't be discussing hidden variables in this lesson. We recommend not using a period at the
beginning of variable names unless you intend your variables to be hidden.

The following will not be able to be used to create a variable


```r
_age
min-length
2widths
```

## Installing Packages

We can use R as a calculator to do mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as we did above. However, we can also use R to carry out more complicated analyses, make visualizations, and much more. In later episodes, we'll use R to do some data wrangling, plotting, and saving of reformatted data.

R coders around the world have developed collections of R code to accomplish themed tasks (e.g., data wrangling). These collections of R code are known as *R packages*. It is also important to note that R packages refer to code that is *not* automatically downloaded when we install R on our computer. Therefore, we'll have to install each R package that we want to use (more on this below).

We will practice using the `dplyr` package to wrangle our datasets in episode 6 and will also practice using the `ggplot2` package to plot our data in episode 7. To give an example, the `dplyr` package includes code for a function called `filter()`. A *function* is something that takes input(s) does some internal operations and produces output(s). For the `filter()` function, the inputs are a dataset and a logical statement (i.e., when data value is greater than or equal to 100) and the output is data within the dataset that has a value greater than or equal to 100.

There are two main ways to install packages in R:

1. If you are using RStudio, we can go to `Tools` > `Install Packages...` and then search for the name of the R package we need and click `Install`.

2. We can use the `install.packages( )` function. We can do this to install the `dplyr` R package.


```r
install.packages("dplyr")
```

```{.output}
The following package(s) will be installed:
- dplyr [1.1.4]
- vctrs [0.6.4]
These packages will be installed into "~/work/r-intro-geospatial/r-intro-geospatial/renv/profiles/lesson-requirements/renv/library/R-4.3/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu".

# Installing packages --------------------------------------------------------
- Installing vctrs ...                          OK [linked from cache]
- Installing dplyr ...                          OK [linked from cache]
Successfully installed 2 packages in 14 milliseconds.
```

It's important to note that we only need to install the R package on our computer once. Well, if we install a new version of R on the same computer, then we will likely need to also re-install the R packages too.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 4

What code would we use to install the `ggplot2` package?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 4

We would use the following R code to install the `ggplot2` package:


```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that we've installed the R package, we're ready to use it! To use the R package, we need to "load" it into our R session. We can think of "loading" an R packages as telling R that we're ready to use the package we just installed. It's important to note that while we only have to install the package *once*, we'll have to load the package *each time we open R (or RStudio)*.

To load an R package, we use the `library( )` function. We can load the `dplyr` package like this:


```r
library(dplyr)
```

```{.output}

Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```{.output}
The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

    filter, lag
```

```{.output}
The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge 5

Which of the following could we use to load the `ggplot2` package? (Select all that apply.)

a) install.packages("ggplot2")
b) library("ggplot2")
c) library(ggplot2)
d) library(ggplo2)

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to challenge 5

The correct answers are b and c.
Answer a will install, not load, the ggplot2 package.
Answer b will correctly load the ggplot2 package. Note there are no quotation marks.
Answer c will correctly load the ggplot2 package. Note there are quotation marks.
Answer d will produce an error because ggplot2 is misspelled.

Note: It is more common for coders to *not use quotation* marks when loading an R package (i.e., answer c).


```r
library(ggplot2)
```
