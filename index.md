The goal of this lesson is to provide an introduction to R for learners
working with geospatial data. It is intended as a pre-requisite for 
the [R for Raster and Vector Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) lesson
for learners who have no prior experience using R. This lesson can
be taught in approximately 4 hours and covers the following topics:

- Working with R in the RStudio GUI
- Project management and file organization
- Importing data into R
- Introduction to R's core data types and data structures
- Manipulation of data frames (tabular data) in R
- Introduction to visualization
- Writing data to a file

The the [R for Raster and Vector Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) lesson
provides a more in-depth introduction to visualization (focusing on geospatial data),
and working with data structures unique to geospatial data.

> ## Getting Started
>
> Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
> their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient 
> workflow. <br>**This lesson assume no prior knowledge of R.**
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup]({{ relative_root_path }}/{% link setup.md %})" tab to 
> download data to your computer and follow any installation instructions.
