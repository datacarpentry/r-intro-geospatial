R has many powerful subset operators. Mastering them will allow you to
easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset.

There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three
different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

Let's start with the workhorse of R: a simple numeric vector.

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
```

{: .callout}

So now that we've created a dummy vector to play with, how do we get at its
contents?

## Accessing elements using their indices

To extract elements of a vector we can give their corresponding index, starting
from one:

```{r}
x[1]
```

```{r}
x[4]
```

It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. For vectors
(and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

We can ask for multiple elements at once:

```{r}
x[c(1, 3)]
```

Or slices of the vector:

```{r}
x[1:4]
```

the `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right.
```{r}
1:4
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```


We can ask for the same element multiple times:

```{r}
x[c(1, 1, 3)]
```

If we ask for an index beyond the length of the vector, R will return a missing value:
```{r}
x[6]
```

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:

```{r}
x[0]
```

> ## Vector numbering in R starts at 1
>
> In many programming languages (C and Python, for example), the first
> element of a vector has an index of 0. In R, the first element is 1.
{: .callout}

## Skipping and removing elements

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return
every element *except* for the one specified:

```{r}
x[-2]
```

We can skip multiple elements:

```{r}
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
```

> ## Tip: Order of operations
>
> A common trip up for novices occurs when trying to skip
> slices of a vector. It's natural to to try to negate a
> sequence like so:
>
> ```{r, error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
> x[-1:3]
> ```
>
> This gives a somewhat cryptic error:
>
> ```{r, error=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
> x[-1:3]
> ```
>
> But remember the order of operations. `:` is really a function.
> It takes its first argument as -1, and its second as 3,
> so generates the sequence of numbers: `c(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3)`.
>
> The correct solution is to wrap that function call in brackets, so
> that the `-` operator applies to the result:
>
> ```{r}
> x[-(1:3)]
> ```
{: .callout}


To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the result back
into the variable:

```{r}
x <- x[-4]
x
```

## Subsetting by name

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of extracting by index:

```{r}
x <- c(a = 5.4, b = 6.2, c = 7.1, d = 4.8, e = 7.5) # we can name a vector 'on the fly'
x[c("a", "c")]
```

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the
position of various elements can often change when chaining together
subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

## Subsetting through other logical operations

We can also use any logical vector to subset:

```{r}
x[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

Since comparison operators (e.g. `>`, `<`, `==`) evaluate to logical vectors, we can also
use them to succinctly subset vectors: the following statement gives
the same result as the previous one.

```{r}
x[x > 7]
```

Breaking it down, this statement first evaluates `x>7`, generating
a logical vector `c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`, and then
selects the elements of `x` corresponding to the `TRUE` values.

We can use `==` to mimic the previous method of indexing by name
(remember you have to use `==` rather than `=` for comparisons):

```{r}
x[names(x) == "a"]
```

> ## Tip: Combining logical conditions
>
> We often want to combine multiple logical
> criteria. For example, we might want to find all the countries that are
> located in Asia **or** Europe **and** have life expectancies within a certain
> range. Several operations for combining logical vectors exist in R:
>
>  * `&`, the "logical AND" operator: returns `TRUE` if both the left and right
>    are `TRUE`.
>  * `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right
>    (or both) are `TRUE`.
>
> You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. These two-character operators
> only look at the first element of each vector and ignore the
> remaining elements. In general you should not use the two-character
> operators in data analysis; save them
> for programming, i.e. deciding whether to execute a statement.
>
>  * `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to
>    `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes
>    `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(eg `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes
>    `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).
>
> Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the
> `all` function (which returns `TRUE` if every element of the vector is `TRUE`)
> and the `any` function (which returns `TRUE` if one or more elements of the
> vector are `TRUE`).

## Data frames

Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules
apply. However they are also two dimensional objects:

`[` with one argument will act the same way as for lists, where each list
element corresponds to a column. The resulting object will be a data frame:

```{r}
head(gapminder[3])
```

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:

```{r}
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
```

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:

```{r}
head(gapminder$year)
```

To select specific rows and/or columns, you can provide two arguments to `[` 

```{r}
gapminder[1:3, ]
```

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because
the elements are mixed types):

```{r}
gapminder[3, ]
```

But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can be changed with
the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).
