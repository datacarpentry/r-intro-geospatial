```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("07-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header=TRUE)
# Silently set seed for random number generation, so we don't have to explain it
set.seed(10)
```

Often when we're coding we want to control the flow of our actions. This can be done
by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met.
Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.

There are several ways you can control flow in R.
For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# if
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}

# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

Say, for example, that we want R to print a message if a variable `x` has a particular value:

```{r}
# sample a random number from a Poisson distribution
# with a mean (lambda) of 8

x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}

x
```

The print statement does not appear in the console because x is not greater than 10. To print a different message for numbers less than 10, we can add an `else` statement.

```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

You can also test multiple conditions by using `else if`.

```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5, but less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

**Important:** when R evaluates the condition inside `if()` statements, it is
looking for a logical element, i.e., `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This can cause some
headaches for beginners. For example:

```{r}
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
} else {
  "4 does not equal 3"          
}
```

As we can see, the not equal message was printed because the vector x is `FALSE`

```{r}
x <- 4 == 3
x
```

Did anyone get a warning message like this?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (gapminder$year == 2012) {}
```

If your condition evaluates to a vector with more than one logical element,
the function `if()` will still run, but will only evaluate the condition in the first
element. Here you need to make sure your condition is of length 1.

## Repeating operations

If you want to iterate over
a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the
same operation on each, a `for()` loop will do the job.
We saw `for()` loops in the shell lessons earlier. This is the most
flexible of looping operations, but therefore also the hardest to use
correctly. Avoid using `for()` loops unless the order of iteration is important:
i.e. the calculation at each iteration depends on the results of previous iterations.

The basic structure of a `for()` loop is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(iterator in set of values){
  do a thing
}
```

For example:

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
```

The `1:10` bit creates a vector on the fly; you can iterate
over any other vector as well.

We can use a `for()` loop nested within another `for()` loop to iterate over two things at
once.

```{r}
for(i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
```

Rather than printing the results, we could write the loop output to a new object.

```{r}
output_vector <- c()
for(i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
output_vector
```

> ## Tip: don't grow your results
>
> This approach can be useful, but 'growing your results' (building
> the result object incrementally) is computationally inefficient, so avoid
> it when you are iterating through a lot of values.


> ## Tip: While loops
>
>
> Sometimes you will find yourself needing to repeat an operation until a certain
> condition is met. You can do this with a `while()` loop.
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> while(this condition is true){
>   do a thing
> }
> ```
>
> As an example, here's a while loop
> that generates random numbers from a uniform distribution (the `runif()` function)
> between 0 and 1 until it gets one that's less than 0.1.
>
> ~~~
> z <- 1
> while(z > 0.1){
>   z <- runif(1)
>   print(z)
> }
> ~~~
> {: .r}
>
> `while()` loops will not always be appropriate. You have to be particularly careful
> that you don't end up in an infinite loop because your condition is never met.

> >
