## Save the data
nordic_orig <- data.frame(country = factor(c("Denmark", "Sweden", "Norway")),
                   year = c(2002, 2002, 2002),
                   lifeExp = c(77.2, 80.0, 79.0))
nordic_bad <- data.frame(country = factor(c("Denmark", "Sweden", "Norway", "Norway")),
                   year = factor(c(2002, 2002, 2002, 2008)),
                   lifeExp = c(77.2, 80.0, 79.0, '78.3 or 83.0'))
nordic <- nordic_orig
```

One of R's most powerful features is its ability to deal with tabular data -
such as you may already have in a spreadsheet or a CSV file. Let's start by
making a toy dataset in your `data/` directory, called `nordic-monarchy-data.csv`:

```{r}
nordic <- data.frame(country = c("Denmark", "Sweden", "Norway"),
                    year = c(2002, 2002, 2002),
                    lifeExp = c(77.2, 80.0, 79.0))
write.csv(x = nordic, file = "data/nordic-monarchy-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
country,year,lifeExp
Denmark,2002,77.2
Sweden,2002,80.0
Norway,2002,79.0
```

> ## Tip: Editing Text files in R
>
> Alternatively, you can create `data/nordic-monarchy-data.csv` using a text editor (Nano),
> or within RStudio with the **File -> New File -> Text File** menu item.
{: .callout}

We can load this into R via the following:

```{r}
nordic <- read.csv(file = "data/nordic-monarchy-data.csv")
nordic
```

The `read.table` function is used for reading in tabular data stored in a text
file where the columns of data are separated by punctuation characters such as
CSV files (csv = comma-separated values). Tabs and commas are the most common
punctuation characters used to separate or delimit data points in csv files.
For convenience R provides 2 other versions of `read.table`. These are: `read.csv`
for files where the data are separated with commas and `read.delim` for files
where the data are separated with tabs. Of these three functions `read.csv` is
the most commonly used.  If needed it is possible to override the default
delimiting punctuation marks for both `read.csv` and `read.delim`.


We can begin exploring our dataset right away, pulling out columns by specifying
them using the `$` operator:

```{r}
nordic$country
nordic$lifeExp
```

We can do other operations on the columns:

```{r}
## Say we discovered that the life expectancy is two years lower:
nordic$lifeExp + 2
paste("Life expectancy is now higher:", nordic$lifeExp)
```

But what about

```{r}
nordic$lifeExp + nordic$country
```

Understanding what happened here is key to successfully analyzing data in R.

## Data Types

If you guessed that the last command will return an error because `2.1` plus
`"black"` is nonsense, you're right - and you already have some intuition for an
important concept in programming called *data types*. We can ask what type of
data something is:

```{r}
typeof(nordic$lifeExp)
```

There are 5 main types: `double`, `integer`, `complex`, `logical` and `character`.

```{r}
typeof(3.14)
typeof(1L) # The L suffix forces the number to be an integer, since by default R uses float numbers
typeof(1+1i)
typeof(TRUE)
typeof('banana')
```

No matter how
complicated our analyses become, all data in R is interpreted as one of these
basic data types. This strictness has some really important consequences.

A user has added new details of age expectancy. This information is in the file
`data/nordic-monarchy-data_v2.csv`.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.show("data/nordic-monarchy-data_v2.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
country,year,lifeExp
Denmark,2002,77.2
Sweden,2002,80
Norway,2002,79
Norway,2008,78.3 or 83.0
```

Load the new cats data like before, and check what type of data we find in the
`weight` column:

```{r}
nordic <- read.csv(file="data/nordic-monarchy-data_v2.csv")
typeof(nordic$lifeExp)
```

Oh no, our life expectancy lifeExp aren't the double type anymore! If we try to do the same math
we did on them before, we run into trouble:

```{r}
nordic$lifeExp + 2
```

What happened? When R reads a csv file into one of these tables, it insists that
everything in a column be the same basic type; if it can't understand
*everything* in the column as a double, then *nobody* in the column gets to be a
double. The table that R loaded our nordic data into is something called a
*data.frame*, and it is our first example of something called a *data
structure* - that is, a structure which R knows how to build out of the basic
data types.

We can see that it is a *data.frame* by calling the `class` function on it:

```{r}
class(nordic)
```

In order to successfully use our data in R, we need to understand what the basic
data structures are, and how they behave. For now, let's remove that extra line
from our nordic data and reload it, while we investigate this behavior further:

nordic-monarchy-data.csv:

```
country,year,lifeExp
Denmark,2002,77.2
Sweden,2002,80.0
Norway,2002,79.0
```

And back in RStudio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nordic_orig <- read.csv(file="data/nordic-monarchy-data.csv")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
nordic <- nordic_orig
```


## Vectors and Type Coercion

To better understand this behavior, let's meet another of the data structures:
the *vector*.

```{r}
my_vector <- vector(length = 3)
my_vector
```

A vector in R is essentially an ordered list of things, with the special
condition that *everything in the vector must be the same basic data type*. If
you don't choose the datatype, it'll default to `logical`; or, you can declare
an empty vector of whatever type you like.


```{r}
another_vector <- vector(mode='character', length=3)
another_vector
```

You can check if something is a vector:

```{r}
str(another_vector)
```

The somewhat cryptic output from this command indicates the basic data type
found in this vector - in this case `chr`, character; an indication of the
number of things in the vector - actually, the indexes of the vector, in this
case `[1:3]`; and a few examples of what's actually in the vector - in this case
empty character strings. If we similarly do

```{r}
str(nordic$lifeExp)
```

we see that `nordic$lifeExp` is a vector, too - *the columns of data we load into R
data.frames are all vectors*, and that's the root of why R forces everything in
a column to be the same basic data type.

You can also make vectors with explicit contents with the combine function:

```{r}
combine_vector <- c(2,6,3)
combine_vector
```

Given what we've learned so far, what do you think the following will produce?

```{r}
quiz_vector <- c(2,6,'3')
```

This is something called *type coercion*, and it is the source of many surprises
and the reason why we need to be aware of the basic data types and how R will
interpret them. When R encounters a mix of types (here numeric and character) to
be combined into a single vector, it will force them all to be the same
type. Consider:

```{r}
coercion_vector <- c('a', TRUE)
coercion_vector
another_coercion_vector <- c(0, TRUE)
another_coercion_vector
```

The coercion rules go: `logical` -> `integer` -> `numeric` -> `complex` ->
`character`, where -> can be read as *are transformed into*. You can try to
force coercion against this flow using the `as.` functions:

```{r}
character_vector_example <- c('0','2','4')
character_vector_example
character_coerced_to_numeric <- as.numeric(character_vector_example)
character_coerced_to_numeric
numeric_coerced_to_logical <- as.logical(character_coerced_to_numeric)
numeric_coerced_to_logical
```

As you can see, some surprising things can happen when R forces one basic data
type into another! Nitty-gritty of type coercion aside, the point is: if your
data doesn't look like what you thought it was going to look like, type coercion
may well be to blame; make sure everything is the same type in your vectors and
your columns of data.frames, or you will get nasty surprises!

But coercion can also be very useful! For example, in our `cats` data
`likes_string` is numeric, but we know that the 1s and 0s actually represent
`TRUE` and `FALSE` (a common way of representing them). We should use the
`logical` datatype here, which has two states: `TRUE` or `FALSE`, which is
exactly what our data represents. We can 'coerce' this column to be `logical` by
using the `as.logical` function:

```{r}
nordic$year
nordic$year <- as.logical(nordic$year)
nordic$year
```
Because all years are greater than 0 the state is TRUE for all countries. We could for instance create a mask where we set year to TRUE for year 2000 and FALSE otherwise:
```{r}
nordic$year
nordic$year <- as.logical(nordic$year==2000)
nordic$year
```

The combine function, `c()`, will also append things to an existing vector:

```{r}
ab_vector <- c('a', 'b')
ab_vector
combine_example <- c(ab_vector, 'SWC')
combine_example
```

You can also make series of numbers:

```{r}
mySeries <- 1:10
mySeries
seq(10)
seq(1,10, by=0.1)
```

We can ask a few questions about vectors:

```{r}
sequence_example <- seq(10)
head(sequence_example, n=2)
tail(sequence_example, n=4)
length(sequence_example)
class(sequence_example)
typeof(sequence_example)
```

Finally, you can give names to elements in your vector:

```{r}
my_example <- 5:8
names(my_example) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
my_example
names(my_example)
```

## Data Frames

We said that columns in data.frames were vectors:

```{r}
str(nordic$lifeExp)
str(nordic$year)
```

These make sense. But what about

```{r}
str(nordic$country)
```

## Factors

Another important data structure is called a *factor*. Factors usually look like
character data, but are typically used to represent categorical information. For
example, let's make a vector of strings labelling nordic countries for all the
countries in our study:

```{r}
nordic <- c('Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden')
nordic
str(nordic)
```

We can turn a vector into a factor like so:

```{r}
categories <- factor(nordic)
class(categories)
str(categories)
```

Now R has noticed that there are three possible categories in our data - but it
also did something surprising; instead of printing out the strings we gave it,
we got a bunch of numbers instead. R has replaced our human-readable categories
with numbered indices under the hood, this is necessary as many statistical
calculations utilise such numerical representations for categorical data:

```{r}
typeof(nordic)
typeof(categories)
```

In modelling functions, it's important to know what the baseline levels are. This
is assumed to be the first factor, but by default factors are labelled in
alphabetical order. You can change this by specifying the levels:

```{r}
mydata <- c("case", "control", "control", "case")
factor_ordering_example <- factor(mydata, levels = c("control", "case"))
str(factor_ordering_example)
```

In this case, we've explicitly told R that "control" should represented by 1, and
"case" by 2. This designation can be very important for interpreting the
results of statistical models!

## Lists

Another data structure you'll want in your bag of tricks is the `list`. A list
is simpler in some ways than the other types, because you can put anything you
want in it:

```{r}
list_example <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
list_example
another_list <- list(title = "Numbers", numbers = 1:10, data = TRUE )
another_list
```

We can now understand something a bit surprising in our data.frame; what happens if we run:

```{r}
typeof(nordic)
```

We see that data.frames look like lists 'under the hood' - this is because a
data.frame is really a list of vectors and factors, as they have to be - in
order to hold those columns that are a mix of vectors and factors, the
data.frame needs something a bit more flexible than a vector to put all the
columns together into a familiar table.  In other words, a `data.frame` is a
special list in which all the vectors must have the same length.

In our `nordic` example, we have an integer, a double and a logical variable. As
we have seen already, each column of data.frame is a vector.

```{r}
nordic$country
nordic[,1]
typeof(nordic[,1])
str(nordic[,1])
```

Each row is an *observation* of different variables, itself a data.frame, and
thus can be composed of elements of different types.

```{r}
nordic[1,]
typeof(nordic[1,])
str(nordic[1,])
```
