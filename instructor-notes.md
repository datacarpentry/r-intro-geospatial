## Instructor notes

## Technical tips and tricks

- Leave about 30 minutes at the start of each workshop and another 15 mins
  at the start of each session for technical difficulties like WiFi and
  installing things (even if you asked students to install in advance, longer if
  not).

- Be sure to actually go through examples of an R help page: help files
  can be intimidating at first, but knowing how to read them is tremendously
  useful.

- Don't worry about being correct or knowing the material back-to-front. Use
  mistakes as teaching moments: the most vital skill you can impart is how to
  debug and recover from unexpected errors.
