# Intro to R for Geospatial data

<!-- TODO: Update first pararaph of the introduction if they data changes -->

An introduction to R for non-programmers using the [Gapminder][gapminder] data.
Please see <https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial> for a rendered
 version of this material,
[the lesson template documentation][lesson-example]
for instructions on formatting, building, and submitting material,
or run `make` in this directory for a list of helpful commands.

The goal of this lesson is to revise best practices for using R in data
 analysis. This lesson is a modification of the [Software Carpentry: Programming with R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder), and is part of the [Data Carpentry Geospatial Curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/). It introduces the R skills needed in the [Introduction to Raster and Vector Geospatial Data lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial).
 
R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and
 its array of third-party packages. These materials are designed to provide
 attendees with a concise introduction in the fundamentals of R, and to introdue
 best practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular
 units, task automation, and encapsulation, before getting started with working
 with geospatial data.

Note that this workshop focuses on the fundamentals of the programming
language R, and not on statistical analysis.

The lesson contains material than can be taught in about 4 hours. The
[instructor notes
page](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/guide/index.html) has some
suggested lesson plans suitable for a one or half day workshop.
