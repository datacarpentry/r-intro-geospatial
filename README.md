# Intro to R for Geospatial data

<!-- TODO: Update first pararaph of the introduction if they data changes -->

An introduction to R for non-programmers using the [Gapminder][gapminder] data.
Please see <https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder> for a rendered
 version of this material,
[the lesson template documentation][lesson-example]
for instructions on formatting, building, and submitting material,
or run `make` in this directory for a list of helpful commands.

The goal of this lesson is to revise best practices for using R in data
 analysis.
R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and
 its array of third-party packages.
These materials are designed to provide attendees with a concise introduction
 in the fundamentals of R, and to introdue best practices for scientific
 computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation,
 and encapsulation, before getting started with working with geospatial data.

Note that this workshop focuses on the fundamentals of the programming
language R, and not on statistical analysis.

The lesson contains more material than can be taught in a day.
The [instructor notes page]({{ page.root }}/guide) has some suggested lesson
 plans suitable for a one or half day workshop.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop.
These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.
